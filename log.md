**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 07, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Import and Export functionnality of Javascript. Aditionally spent some time going through Just Javascript course by Dan Abramov and cosequently finished the first two modules.

**Thoughts:** Personally I think it is a very cool feature to use functions and variables from diffrent module. What I found was we need to include type = "module" inside the <script> tag to make this work. 
  Just Javascript just changed the way how I looked into variables and values. Stuffs started making sense. I am really glad I came across this course.

  
 ### Day 2: June 08, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Studies some concept of async Javascript and went through some Just Javascript course



**Thoughts** Studies concept related to callback functions in JS and wrote a small implementation of it. Came across Callback hell. As usual spent some time on Just Javascript course and finished the 'Values and Variables' module today. Really happy that I purchased this course.

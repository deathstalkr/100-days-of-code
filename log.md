**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 07, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Import and Export functionnality of Javascript. Aditionally spent some time going through Just Javascript course by Dan Abramov and cosequently finished the first two modules.

**Thoughts:** Personally I think it is a very cool feature to use functions and variables from diffrent module. What I found was we need to include type = "module" inside the <script> tag to make this work. 
  Just Javascript just changed the way how I looked into variables and values. Stuffs started making sense. I am really glad I came across this course.

  
 ### Day 2: June 08, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Studied some concept of async Javascript and went through some JustJavascript course

**Thoughts** Studies concept related to callback functions in JS and wrote a small implementation of it. Came across Callback hell. As usual spent some time on Just Javascript course and finished the 'Values and Variables' module today. Really happy that I purchased this course.

### Day 3: June 09, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Async Javascript; learned about Promises and Asyns/await


**Thoughts** Learned a lot on the asynchronous Javascript and thanks to Joy for making it so much simpler to wrap my head around. Callbacks, Promises and Async/await are really cool and takes Javascript to a whole new level. Today tried creating ice-creams procedurally with time constrains by implementing Async feature of Javascript using all three techniques(Callbacks, Promises and Async/await). Need to work on it more to get a hold of it.
  
  
  ### Day 4: June 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started off with some vanilla JS projects. Completed 4th module of JustJavascript

  
**Thoughts** Put some effort into starting off with some Vanilla JS projects to get some handson experience. Started off by coding some basic HTML for a color flipper app which changes color on random when the button is clicked. More on it tomorrow. Aditionally read some more about Javascript Universe and its view from inside. 
  
  
### Day 5: June 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed my first Hands-on JS project. Finished with 5th module of JustJS

**Thoughts** Fisished my first vanilla JS hands-on project with style. Created a color flipper application which changes background color on the fly by generating random hex numbers. Really excited to build more projects like this and can't wait to show it to teh world. Aditionally, as usual completed
the 5th module of JJS XD.I'm now really able to get the hang of the Javascript Universe mental model. Understood in depth about primitive values and got to konw a bug in JS where "typeof" function returns **object** for 'null' even though it being a primitive data type and also the only value of such type.

### Day 6: June 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed my Second Hands-on JS project.

**Thoughts** Continuing my JS learning streak, as today I completed my second basic JS project called 'Counter' which updates the HTML DOM when increase, decrease or reset buttons are clicked and additionally update the text color based on the integer category(-:red, 0:black, +:green). Learned a new technique of listening to multiple button clicks simultaneousy and then filter the event based on the class returned of the button clicked using "event.currentTarget.classList" to perform the necessary action. Will venture into JJS universe tomorrow.

 ### Day 7: June 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed my Third Hands-on JS project back to back in three days. Super stoked

**Thoughts** Had a very hectic day but still managed to pull some time off to build another tiny project which shows reviews of random people with all the details, by pulling off the details from an array. DOM gets updated with a new review each time any of the next, previous or random button is clicked. This is easy and quite similar to the previous ones, but still managed to learn how to load default content when a HTML DOM is fully loaded by using the 'addEventListner' of the window object and use 'DOMContentLoaded' as the trigger. 
Another day went dry without compleating a JJS module. Will hopefully be able to pick it up by the end of this week.
